 This operation demultiplexes the incoming stream into separate output
 streams, one for each element key. The key is computed for each element
 using the given function. When a new key is encountered for the first time
 it is emitted to the downstream subscriber together with a fresh
 flow that will eventually produce all the elements of the substream
 for that key. Not consuming the elements from the created streams will
 stop this processor from processing more elements, therefore you must take
 care to unblock (or cancel) all of the produced streams even if you want
 to consume only one of them.

<summary>
 Allows a faster downstream to progress independently of a slower publisher by extrapolating elements from an older

 the subscriber until it receives an update from upstream.

 This element will never &quot;drop&quot; upstream elements as all elements go through at least one extrapolation step.
 This means that if the upstream is actually faster than the upstream it will be backpressured by the downstream
 subscriber.

 Expand does not support restart and resume directives. Exceptions from the extrapolate function will complete the stream with failure.

 Ensure stream boundedness by evaluating the cost of incoming elements
 using a cost function. Exactly how many elements will be allowed to travel downstream depends on the

 Due to input buffering some elements may have been
 requested from upstream publishers that will then not be processed downstream

<summary>
 Allows a faster downstream to progress independently of a slower publisher by extrapolating elements from an older
 element until new element comes from the upstream. For example an expand step might repeat the last element for
 the subscriber until it receives an update from upstream.

 This element will never &quot;drop&quot; upstream elements as all elements go through at least one extrapolation step.
 This means that if the upstream is actually faster than the upstream it will be backpressured by the downstream
 subscriber.

 Expand does not support restart and resume directives. Exceptions from the extrapolate function will complete the stream with failure.

 Create a source which materializes a completion result which controls what element
 will be emitted by the Source.

<summary>
 Elements are emitted periodically with the specified interval.
 The tick element will be delivered to downstream consumers that has requested any elements.
 If a consumer has not requested any elements at the point in time when the tick
 element is produced it will not receive that tick element later. It will
 receive new tick elements as soon as it has requested more elements.

 Start a new source from the given Async computation. The stream will consist of
 one element when the computation is completed with a successful value, which
 may happen before or after materializing the flow.
 The stream terminates with a failure if the task is completed with a failure.
